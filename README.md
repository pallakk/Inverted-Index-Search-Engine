# Inverted Index Search Engine

## Overview

This repository contains a conceptual implementation of an **Inverted Index Search Engine**. The system demonstrates how large-scale document collections can be indexed and queried using scalable processing techniques and relevance ranking algorithms.

## Key Features

- Scalable indexing using distributed processing concepts (e.g., MapReduce).
- Document ranking based on TF-IDF and PageRank principles.
- REST API design for handling search queries.
- Conceptual web interface for displaying ranked search results.

## Project Scope

This project was completed as part of a university-level course on large-scale information retrieval. The objective was to apply theoretical knowledge of search engines, indexing, and ranking algorithms in a simulated development environment.
